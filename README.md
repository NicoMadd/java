# AA for All About

## Java

This is an all about Java. Here you will find several examples of how to use Java different packages. There will also be examples and an explanation about.

The priority here is to make sure the reader learns those components, classes and methods that maybe go unaware for the common programmer and should be basic for anyone, since there are people who put effort into making it and are an out-of-the-box stuff.

## Structure

You will find that each folder corresponds to a JDK version. It should be possible that the examples implementation are for the exact use of those versions. There may be some deprecated features, in those cases, a notice about it should be suffice.

All examples will be accompanied by an exercise for the reader to challenge itself and understand the use case.
